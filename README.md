The app was designed to address the needs of users seeking a comprehensive solution for tracking weight and managing fitness goals. Its primary goal is to help users stay motivated and organized in their health journeys by providing a centralized platform for tracking progress. As someone who recently began working out, I found existing apps lacked the key features I needed, which inspired me to create a solution that integrates these functions while keeping the interface simple and intuitive. The app includes essential screens like a Login Screen for secure access, a Dashboard for logging and viewing weight trends, and a Home Screen for updating goals. These screens prioritize user-centered design by offering straightforward navigation, minimalistic layouts, and accessible features. The app caters to users seeking a straightforward and effective tool for managing their fitness progress by focusing on essential needs.
The development process was guided by a systematic approach emphasizing modularity and scalability. I began by designing the database schema to ensure efficient local storage and retrieval of user-specific data, followed by iterative development of core functionalities. Testing was a critical part of this process, with unit and integration tests ensuring each component worked seamlessly and manual testing identifying areas for improvement. This approach ensured the appâ€™s functionality and allowed me to refine error handling and edge case management, resulting in a robust and user-friendly product. One of the highlights of this project was the integration of personalized goal tracking, which demonstrated my ability to design solutions that are both technically sound and meaningful to users. By offering this app for free, I hope to encourage more people to embrace healthier lifestyles, reflecting my commitment to making fitness accessible to everyone.
